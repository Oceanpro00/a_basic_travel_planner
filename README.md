# Basic Travel Planner

**Basic Travel Planner** is a modular, self-hosted **trip planning and visualization system** for building interactive, multi-stop travel maps. Built entirely with Leaflet.js and vanilla JavaScript, it now includes both a full-featured **Planner UI** and a clean **Viewer UI**, offering a seamless way to create, preview, and share detailed itineraries — all without a database or server.

Whether you're a creator crafting a trip journal, a traveler organizing an adventure, or a developer prototyping ideas, this planner offers complete flexibility, privacy, and portability.

This project aims to offer an elegant alternative to bloated, ad-ridden, or paywalled travel planning tools. With it, you can:

- Highlight cities and must-see locations
- Showcase restaurants, cafes, activities, and hotels
- Visually plan routes and stages
- Present immersive, image-rich trip previews

Whether you're crafting a travel journal, pitching a trip idea, or building a personal trip site, this planner is adaptable, extendable, and fully offline-capable.

- [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) - Detailed version history

### 🤖 Option 3: AI-Generated Trip Data (Fastest for Large Trips)

**Perfect for:** Anyone who wants to quickly generate comprehensive trip data using AI tools.

**Why This Method:**
- **Much faster** than manually filling out the v0.2 UI for large trips
- **More comprehensive** than manual entry - AI can suggest locations you might miss
- **Consistent formatting** - follows the exact API structure
- **Easily customizable** - edit the generated code afterward

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Prepare Your Resources:**
   - **Upload files to AI:** Upload the `basic_travel_planner_cheatsheet.md` and sample `tripData.js` from the Tuscany example
   - **Alternative:** Copy-paste the cheat sheet and example structure if file upload isn't available
   - **Note:** Most AIs struggle with realistic photo URLs, so plan to add those yourself (fixes planned for future versions)

2. **Choose Your Prompt Type:**

   **Option A - Complete Trip Generation:**
   ```
   Create a tripData.js file for a [X-day trip to LOCATION]. 
   Use the API functions from the uploaded cheat sheet.
   
   Include:
   - 5-8 path points (main cities/areas)
   - 10-15 activities and must-dos
   - 8-12 restaurants and cafes
   - Hotel suggestions for each path point
   - Real coordinates (lat/lng)
   - Placeholder photo URLs (I'll replace these myself)
   
   Follow the structure from the uploaded example file.
   ```

   **Option B - Build Around Specific Interests:**
   ```
   Create a tripData.js file for [LOCATION] focused on [YOUR INTERESTS].
   Use the API functions from the uploaded cheat sheet.
   
   I specifically want to include:
   - [Specific place 1] - because [reason]
   - [Specific place 2] - because [reason]
   - [Activity type] experiences
   - [Food preference] restaurants
   
   Build a complete trip around these priorities, adding complementary locations.
   Include real coordinates and placeholder photo URLs.
   Follow the structure from the uploaded example.
   ```

3. **Use ChatGPT/Claude:**
   - Upload your files or paste the documentation
   - Use one of the prompt templates above
   - Describe your destination and trip preferences
   - Request a complete tripData.js file
   - **Important:** Expect to replace photo URLs yourself

3. **Refine the Output:**
   ```
   Make these adjustments to the tripData.js:
   - Add more restaurants in Florence
   - Include hiking activities in Cinque Terre
   - Focus on art museums and galleries
   - Add budget-friendly cafe options
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   - Copy the generated code into `/docs/versions/v0.1_manual_map/empty_template/tripData.js`
   - **Replace placeholder photos with real URLs** (this step is crucial)
   - Test locally and deploy to any static hosting service

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
Create a tripData.js file for a 7-day trip to Portugal focusing on Lisbon, Porto, and coastal towns. 

Use these API functions:
- addPathPoint(number, name, description, lat, lng, options)
- addActivity(name, description, lat, lng, options)
- addFood(name, description, lat, lng, options)
- addCafe(name, description, lat, lng, options)

Include:
- 6 path points covering major cities and regions
- 15 activities (mix of historic sites, viewpoints, and cultural experiences)
- 10 restaurants (traditional Portuguese cuisine)
- 8 cafes (including famous pastéis de nata spots)
- Hotel suggestions with exterior/room photo placeholders
- Real GPS coordinates for all locations

Follow this exact structure: [paste example from existing tripData.js]
```

**Pro Tips for AI Generation:**
- **Upload files when possible** - more reliable than copy-pasting long documents
- **Be specific** about trip focus (food, culture, nature, budget level)
- **Provide your must-see locations** and let AI build around them
- **Ask for real coordinates** - AI is surprisingly good at accurate lat/lng
- **Expect to handle photos yourself** - AI photo URL generation is unreliable
- **Iterate in chunks** - generate path points first, then activities, then food
