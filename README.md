# Basic Travel Planner

**Basic Travel Planner** is a modular, self-hosted travel visualization tool for mapping multi-stop trips with rich detail. Built entirely with Leaflet.js and vanilla JavaScript, it enables creators, travelers, and developers to design flexible, interactive itineraries with **zero backend dependencies**.

This project aims to offer an elegant alternative to bloated, ad-ridden, or paywalled travel planning tools. With it, you can:

- Highlight cities and must-see locations
- Showcase restaurants, cafes, activities, and hotels
- Visually plan routes and stages
- Present immersive, image-rich trip previews

Whether you're crafting a travel journal, pitching a trip idea, or building a personal trip site, this planner is adaptable, extendable, and fully offline-capable.

## Getting Started

To reproduce or deploy this project:

1. Clone or fork the repository
2. Open `/docs/tripData.js`

   * Use `addPathPoint()`, `addActivity()`, `addMustDo()`, and `addFood()`
3. Open `/docs/index.html` in any browser or deploy via GitHub Pages
4. Edit `tripTitle` to change the document title

---

## Customize Your Trip

* Modify any location or marker in `tripData.js`
* Use direct image URLs or local files in `/assets`
* Add hotels per stop with room and exterior photo options
* All layout and visual design lives in `styles.css`

## Build Notes

This project was developed through iterative prototyping and AI-supported collaboration. It blends automation with handcrafted logic to offer a smooth user experience across devices.

* **Claude AI** (Anthropic) was used to scaffold early logic and generate UI patterns
* **ChatGPT** helped rapidly iterate, debug, and explore refactors
* **Custom implementation** handled interaction logic, UX polish, marker handling, and mobile responsiveness

The result is a lightweight planner that can be easily customized or extended, serving as both a technical portfolio piece and a base for future travel tools.

## Tech Stack

* HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no frameworks)
* Leaflet.js for map rendering
* Hosted via GitHub Pages

## Future Ideas

The current version is a strong foundation, but future iterations may include:

* A drag-and-drop UI planner for trip building

* Optional date & timeline integration
* Theme support (dark mode, city-specific looks)
* Export to printable PDF or shareable links
