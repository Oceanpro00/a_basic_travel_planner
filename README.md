# Basic Travel Planner

A clean, self-hosted, interactive travel visualizer built in just 4 focused days.

This project was created to address the lack of visually intuitive, lightweight, and affordable tools for planning trips. Many existing platforms are either paywalled, confusing, ad-heavy, or limited to static documents that are hard to edit, carry, or use interactively on the go. This planner aims to subvert that.

Built for portfolio demonstration and future growth, it delivers a scalable client-side platform for visualizing multi-stop travel routes using Leaflet.js and plain JavaScript. Users can explore cities, highlight activities, toggle between hotel views, and manage their trip spatially â€” all in-browser, with no backend required.

While basic JavaScript knowledge or access to an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) is recommended for setup, the system is intentionally straightforward to use. Future versions will include a more robust planner UI, optional AI assistance, and broader travel utilities â€” while preserving user privacy and browser-based flexibility.

## Features

* Fully client-side: no backend, no database
* Map powered by Leaflet.js with custom marker styling
* Clickable stops, activities, food spots, and must-do highlights
* Visual legend to filter marker types (Activity, Must-Do, Food)
* Side panel with:

  * Image carousel
  * Description, link, and auto-tagged keywords
  * Toggle for hotel exterior vs. room views
* Responsive layout and mobile-ready behavior

---

## Getting Started

To reproduce or deploy this project:

1. Clone or fork the repository
2. Open `/docs/tripData.js`

   * Use `addPathPoint()`, `addActivity()`, `addMustDo()`, and `addFood()`
3. Open `/docs/index.html` in any browser or deploy via GitHub Pages
4. Edit `tripTitle` to change the document title

---

## Customize Your Trip

* Modify any location or marker in `tripData.js`
* Use direct image URLs or local files in `/assets`
* Add hotels per stop with room and exterior photo options
* All layout and visual design lives in `styles.css`

## Build Notes

This project was built in just 4 focused days with a mix of AI collaboration and hands-on coding.

* **Claude AI** (Anthropic) was used to scaffold early logic and generate UI patterns
* **ChatGPT** helped rapidly iterate, debug, and explore refactors
* **Custom implementation** handled interaction logic, UX polish, marker handling, and mobile responsiveness

The result is a lightweight planner that can be easily customized or extended, serving as both a technical portfolio piece and a base for future travel tools.

---

## Tech Stack

* HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no frameworks)
* Leaflet.js for map rendering
* Hosted via GitHub Pages
